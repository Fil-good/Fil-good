## Introduction

👋 Hi, I’m @Fil-good :smile:,

Yo guys, 

After 15 years of recruitment within Hays, it was time to move to the other side of the table. An important reason for this is the lack of developers in the market 😀, but even more important, I needed a new challenge. 

In 2020, I started discovering the youtube channel of IvanOnTech, a former blockchain developer who devoted himself at that time to educating his listeners in different subjects, from general finance theory, central bank governance, to supply chain (see VeChain, crypto asset), DeFi, basic blockchain theory, the working of an automated market maker (AMM), ..   
Although a developer, this guy combines both technical and fantastic communication skills, but moreover, he gets straight to the point in a genuine way. I recommend warmly to look up his website [Moralis.io](https://moralis.io/).

So I started learning basic blockchain theory, html, css, and JavaScript on the platform IvanOnTech. 

In this Covid period, starting beginning 2020, and continuing until late 2021, I had plenty of time to reflect on the mid-career (mid-life?) questions. I came across a bootcamp organized in Brussels, where I live.. 


## Career Switch - Le Wagon and further on..

### Overview Bootcamp content

$9-week full-time/24-week part-time$ intensive coding bootcamp learning HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript ES6,
SQL, git, GitHub, Heroku and Ruby on Rails. Designed, implemented and shipped to production a clone of AirBnB [AirBnbClone](https://github.com/Nicolas1950/ACTORS_AT_HOME) and a Rails prototype of [TheRealAndOnlyBugsBuddies](https://github.com/Agoushch/Bugs_Buddy). 

### Reflections

Le Wagon has a highly performing team in Brussels. A special thanks I would like to express to all staff, Pascaline Dierckx, the city manager, George Kosmopoulos, the lead teacher, all teachers: Nicolas Agathos, Margo Tinawi, Louise Picot, Olivier Nottebart, George Kosmopoulos, and the TA's: Aaron Staes, Luis Fernando Ghidelli, Jean-Sébastien Morel, Olivier Nottebart, and Louise Picot. 

Giving all basic elements to manage the creation of a 'simple' or even more complex website (with some API, some Javascript), all knowledge is assimilated a first time in the cloning exercise of the site of AirBnB, in one week time. The last two weeks were destined to design our own project, chosen from 9 pitched projects, of which 5 survived. 

In our team, with Adonis Goushchi, Thibaut Butaye, and my brother 😂, Nicolas Brouwers, we had a lot of fun, but also, we learned a lot, not only code, but also working together on Git and Github. I hope we'll meet soon again.
