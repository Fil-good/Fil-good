## Introduction

Hi, 

After 10 years of recruiting, it was time to move to the other side of the table. I needed a new challenge!
In 2020, I started learning basic blockchain theory, html, css, and JavaScript on the platform of Moralis. 
Then I came across a bootcamp organized in Brussels, where I live.. and a bootcamp that is highly rated throughout Europe.


## Career Switch - Le Wagon and further on..

### Overview Bootcamp content

$9-week full-time intensive coding bootcamp learning HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript ES6,
SQL, git, GitHub, Heroku and Ruby on Rails. Designed, implemented and shipped to production a clone of AirBnB [AirBnbClone](https://github.com/Nicolas1950/ACTORS_AT_HOME) and a Rails prototype of [TheRealAndOnlyBugsBuddies](https://github.com/Agoushch/Bugs_Buddy). 

### Reflections

Le Wagon has a highly performing team in Brussels. A special thanks I would like to express to all staff, Pascaline Dierckx, the city manager, George Kosmopoulos, the lead teacher, all teachers: Nicolas Agathos, Margo Tinawi, Louise Picot, Olivier Nottebart, George Kosmopoulos, and the TA's: Aaron Staes, Luis Fernando Ghidelli, Jean-SÃ©bastien Morel, Olivier Nottebart, and Louise Picot. 

Giving all basic elements to manage the creation of a 'simple' or even more complex website (with some API, some Javascript), all knowledge is assimilated a first time in the cloning exercise of the site of AirBnB, in one week time. The last two weeks were destined to design our own project, chosen from 9 pitched projects, of which 5 survived. 

In our team, with Adonis Goushchi, Thibaut Butaye, and Nicolas Brouwers, we had a lot of fun, but also, we learned a lot, not only code, but also working together on Git and Github.
